# About sergeyfilimonov.com

Hi! My name is Sergey Filimonov. I live in Moscow, Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º

For the last 5 years, I have developed tens of websites with WordPress and love it very much but still I believe the future is for static websites. The first really good framework [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) had great impact on the industry but here I think the future of static websites is for Vue, not React. That's why I chose [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) as the main framework to invest my time in.

This repo represents the inside of my personal website [sergeyfilimonov.com](https://sergeyfilimonov.com) which is madeâ€”as you might guessâ€”with Gridsome. Feel free to explore it and look for something to use in your projects.

ðŸš€ Other static websites I made with Gridsome:
- [hr.netology.ru](https://hr.netology.ru)

ðŸ”œ Coming soon:
- [ms.netology.ru](https://ms.netology.ru)
- [msp-moscow.ru](https://msp-moscow.ru)
- [cbsd.ru](https://cbsd.ru)
