# About sergeyfilimonov.com

Hi! My name is Sergey Filimonov. I live in Moscow, Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º

For the last 5 years, I have developed tens of websites with WordPress and love it very much but still I believe the future is for static websites.

The first really good framework [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) had great impact on the industry but here I think the future of static websites is for Vue, not React. That's why I chose [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) as the main framework to invest my time in. Now I am also among maintainers team of Gridsome helping develop it.

This repo represents the inside of my personal website [sergeyfilimonov.com](https://sergeyfilimonov.com) which is madeâ€”as you might guessâ€”with Gridsome. Feel free to explore it and look for something to use in your projects.
